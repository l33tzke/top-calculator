The Odin Project: Calculator

Final project from the Foundations section from The Odin Project.

From the basic proposal in the assignment, I took the liberty of deviating regarding the possibility of stringing together several operations, as it goes against the most common design in simple calculators.
Instead, when the user clicks an operator after having already 2 operands in place, the calculator will resolve the pending operation before committing to the new one, so that the user is always focused on the current status of the calculation.
